# Hangman Game

A simple Hangman game implemented in Python.

## How to Play

1. The game will randomly select a word from a predefined list.
2. You have six lives (attempts) to guess the word by suggesting letters.
3. Each incorrect guess reduces your remaining lives by one.
4. The game ends when you either guess the word correctly or run out of lives.
5. Correct guesses are displayed in their correct positions in the word.
6. Incorrect guesses are tracked and displayed.
